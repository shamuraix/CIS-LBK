The CIS Linux Build Kit (CIS-LBK) is a GZIP Compressed Tar Archive file containing the file structure and files
necessary to remediate the target system into alignment with a specific CIS Linux Benchmark.

Script Execution:
	By default the script will execute in interactive mode. This is the method we suggest that the Build Kit be excuted in
	most situations.

	If automating the execution is required the script supports 2 parameters to facilitate silent execution

		-s - This parameter directes the script to execute in silent mode.
		-p "<profile_name>" - This parameter passes the profile name the script should use. (Required if using -s above)

		A sample silent CLI command would look similar to:

		'buildkit_script_name.sh -s -p "Level 1 - Server"'

Exclusion List:
	The CIS-LBK include a file called "exclusion_list.txt".  This file allows for recommendations to be excluded
	from the LBK's remediation.

	To use this file, add the number of the recommendation you would like excluded.  Each recommendation's number
	should be added to its own line in this file

Output Log Files:
	The CIS-LBK will output a number of log files. These files are stored in the 'logs' directory

	CIS-LBK.log - The standard log file containing final status of each Build Kit item.
	CIS-LBK_error.log - This file captures errors generated by the main script.
	CIS-LBK_failed.log - This file captures the list of Build Kit items that failed remediation.
	CIS-LBK_manual.log - This file captures the Build Kit items that cannot be automatically remediated. The items
	                     in this log will require manual remediation.
	CIS-LBK_verbose.log - This file captures the verbose output of each Build Kit item's execution.

Remediation Function Return Codes:
	101 - Passed - No remediation required
	102 - Failed - Manual Remediation may be required
	103 - Remediated - Build Kit successfully remediated the recommendation
	104 - Not Applicable - Recommendation has been determined to be non applicable
	105 - Skipped - Recommendation is not part of the selected profile or has been added to the excluded list
	106 - Manual - Recommendation needs to be remediated manually
